# Oteryn Platform Repository Map

Navigation map for autonomous agents. This is not an exhaustive inventory. Confirm current paths before editing.

## Product/application paths

| Area | Typical paths | Responsibility / cautions |
|---|---|---|
| Application core | `app/**` | Laravel application logic. Keep domain/module responsibilities explicit and avoid unrelated refactors. |
| HTTP / API | `routes/**`, `app/Http/**` | Public routes, middleware, controllers, request validation and API boundaries. Treat auth-sensitive endpoints as security-critical. |
| Authentication / identity | planned module paths under `app/**` plus auth configuration | Passwords, sessions, MFA, verification, recovery. Read security + game-login contract before implementation. |
| Database | `database/migrations/**`, `database/seeders/**`, `database/factories/**` | Platform schema/data changes. Shared Canary schema is contract-controlled. |
| Canary integration | planned integration adapters, `config/**`, `docs/contracts/**` | Never assume generic TFS/MyAAC schema. Verify Oteryn Canary evidence. |
| Public web / CMS | `resources/views/**`, `resources/js/**`, `resources/css/**` | Blade/frontend/CMS. Escape untrusted output and preserve CSRF protections. |
| Admin | planned admin controllers/routes/policies/views | Privileged operations. Explicit policies, MFA target and auditability required. |
| Tests | `tests/**` | Unit, feature, integration, contract and security regression tests. |
| Configuration | `config/**`, `.env.example` | Commit examples only. Never commit real credentials, tokens or production secrets. |
| CI | `.github/workflows/**` | Required checks and deployment validation. Do not weaken checks to obtain green CI. |

## Architecture and durable project memory

| Area | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Current project state | `docs/agents/PROJECT_STATE.md` | Compact authoritative entry point for current phase, capabilities, unknowns and next work. |
| Active work index | `docs/agents/ACTIVE_WORK.md` | Convenience index; verify individual task and PR. |
| Active tasks | `docs/agents/tasks/active/**` | Authoritative task checkpoint/ownership records. |
| Archived tasks | `docs/agents/tasks/archive/**` | Completed historical task records. |
| System architecture | `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` | System context, trust boundaries and dependency rules. |
| Module catalog | `docs/architecture/MODULE_CATALOG.md` | Module responsibility and ownership. |
| Security architecture | `docs/architecture/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Mandatory security invariants. |
| Data ownership | `docs/architecture/DATA_OWNERSHIP.md` | Platform/Canary/shared persistent data rules. |
| Test strategy | `docs/architecture/TEST_STRATEGY.md` | Unit/feature/integration/contract/E2E strategy. |
| Roadmap | `docs/architecture/ROADMAP.md` | Phased delivery order and exit gates. |
| ADRs | `docs/architecture/adr/**` | Durable decisions and supersession history. |
| Integration contracts | `docs/contracts/**` | Canary/login-server/shared schema/auth compatibility. |
| Agent governance | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agents/CONTEXT_*` | Coordination, routing and handoff rules. |

## Mandatory discovery for shared data/auth

Before implementing shared auth/account/character mutations, search/read:

- `docs/contracts/AUTH_GAME_LOGIN_CONTRACT.md`;
- `docs/contracts/CANARY_DATA_CONTRACT.md`;
- `docs/architecture/DATA_OWNERSHIP.md`;
- `docs/architecture/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Then verify the actual external repository/schema evidence. Documentation placeholders do not prove compatibility.

## Discovery commands

```sh
find . -name AGENTS.md -print
find docs/agents/tasks/active -maxdepth 1 -type f -print
rg -n "UNKNOWN|CONFLICT|DISCOVERY" docs/architecture docs/contracts docs/agents
rg -n "auth|session|mfa|password|account|player|guild|canary|login-server" app routes config database tests docs
rg -n "Route::|middleware|Gate::|Policy|Hash::|DB::transaction" app routes tests
```

Use targeted discovery. Do not preload the whole repository when a narrow search can identify the relevant module or contract.
