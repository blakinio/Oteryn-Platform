# Oteryn Platform Active Work

Convenience index only. The individual active task record, live PR and Git state are authoritative.

## Active tasks

- `OTERYN-20260719-mfa-state-foundation` — Phase 3 T3.4a Platform-only encrypted MFA state and internal MFA reset/session-revocation foundation; branch `task/OTERYN-20260719-mfa-state-foundation`; draft PR pending. Scope deliberately excludes TOTP generation/verification, public MFA routes, login challenge/enforcement, Admin/RBAC and all Canary/login-server changes.

## Recommended next task

After T3.4a is merged, create a separate MFA enrollment/challenge/enforcement task only after a maintained TOTP provider can be added through a real Composer dependency update with a generated lockfile. Platform web MFA must not be described as a global game-login gate while alternate Canary/login-server paths remain unresolved.

## Other queued work

- `OTERYN-20260719-online-list-read-model` remains a valid independent PublicGameData task to implement the approved cluster-wide online-character read model from `cluster_sessions` plus public player fields. It must enforce `status = 'ONLINE'`, unexpired `expires_at`, `players.deletion = 0`, explicit dependency-failure semantics and the existing query-only Canary boundary; do not use `players_online` or add shared writes.
