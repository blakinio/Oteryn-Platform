## Current project phase

**Phase 6 — CMS, Admin, RBAC and Audit: COMPLETE**

**Phase 7 — Production hardening and operations: COMPLETE**

## Operational release state

- **Production Readiness: STAGING_PROVEN**
- **Functional Acceptance: STAGING_PROVEN for the currently delivered staging-verifiable functional surface**
- **Visual / UX Acceptance: PASS for the currently delivered staging-verifiable launch scope**
- **Production Go-Live Gate: PENDING PRODUCTION VERIFICATION**
- **Production Verification: REQUIRED BEFORE GO-LIVE**

No staging evidence may be promoted to `PRODUCTION_PROVEN`.

## Next work

Keep production-only smoke and the Production Go-Live Gate separate until the exact final deployed SHA and explicit production authorization are available.

## Remaining cross-repository dependency

The authoritative Platform game-login bridge remains separate and requires explicit authorization before external repository writes if it is part of launch scope.

## Coordination rule

Before starting substantial work, search `docs/agents/tasks/active/**` and open PRs for overlapping paths or intent. Do not claim paths already owned by another active task without explicit coordination.
