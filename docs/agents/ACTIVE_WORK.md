# Oteryn Platform Active Work

Convenience index only. The individual active task record, live PR and Git state are authoritative.

## Active tasks

- `OTERYN-20260719-phase4-public-read-closure` — bounded Phase 4 closure/revalidation; branch `task/OTERYN-20260719-phase4-public-read-closure`; draft PR #23; checkpoint status `ready`. Source-level revalidation found and fixed one concrete Phase 4 exit-gate gap: the cluster-wide `/online` read ended in an unbounded `get()`. It now paginates 100 rows per page with route-level regression coverage. Delivery-validation head `3bd2a7ede415f2dc386ca1f7dc39f4d14d062e15` passed CI #380 and Agent Governance #301. Phase 4 is marked complete by this closure only if the final ready-checkpoint head also passes exact-head CI/Governance before squash merge. No Phase 5 shared writes, Phase 6 Admin/RBAC/CMS authoring, deployment or payments work is authorized by this task.

## Recommended next task

After PR #23 is squash-merged and Phase 4 is verified complete on `main`, derive one bounded Phase 5 operation-contract/discovery task from live repository state. Select one concrete account or character operation, prove its Canary/shared-data ownership, authorization, validation, transaction, concurrency, side-effect and rollback contract, and do not implement any shared write until that operation contract is explicitly approved.

## Other queued work

- Authoritative cross-component credential/game-login migration remains a later separately coordinated programme under `AUTH_GAME_LOGIN_CONTRACT.md`; Phase 3 completion does not authorize shared Canary credential writes.
- Admin/RBAC identity classification and permissions remain Phase 6. Future privileged routes must combine explicit authorization with the Phase 3 `mfa.confirmed` gate rather than an `is_admin` shortcut.
- Privileged/group-hidden public-ranking policy, production runtime Redis ACL/endpoint provisioning, exact production wall-clock skew and broader cache policy remain explicit later policy/deployment unknowns; Phase 4 closure does not guess or silently resolve them.
