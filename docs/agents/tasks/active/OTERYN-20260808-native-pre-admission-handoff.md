# OTERYN-20260808 native pre-admission handoff

## Goal

Define the Platform-side semantic boundary for native pre-admission material handed from Platform/Game Gateway to Oteryn-v2, preserving accepted authority while leaving final game-domain admission/session/lease/fencing implementation external and read-only.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Focused contract defines pre-admission purpose, authority, canonical identities, binding, freshness, expiry and replay semantics.
- [x] Pre-admission material is explicitly not canonical `GameSessionId`, gameplay lease or proof of final admission.
- [x] Issuance preconditions compose authoritative ticket redemption, character authorization, World Registry policy and fresh applicable runtime evidence.
- [x] Failure, ambiguity, duplicate/replay, channel-switch and reconnect boundaries fail closed without inventing Oteryn-v2 implementation.
- [x] Focused integration and Gateway/Identity documentation route to the contract without reactivating historical Platform gameplay authority.
- [x] Native account identity is reconciled with ADR 0028: native ticket/redeem authority uses canonical `AccountId`; delivered `canary_account_id` redeem v1 remains compatibility evidence only.
- [x] Oteryn-v2 remains read-only; exact transport/encoding/signing/lease/fencing/GameSessionId wire format remain deferred.
- [ ] Exact-head Agent Governance and repository-selected CI pass; full diff/review has zero unresolved material findings.
- [x] Runtime/browser E2E is `NOT_APPLICABLE` because this task is architecture/documentation only.

proven:
  - Platform ADR 0031 owns Identity, Game Login Ticket, World Registry and Gateway pre-admission orchestration while assigning final gameplay admission and authoritative admitted session/lease/fencing to Oteryn-v2.
  - Read-only Oteryn-v2 ADR-0003 makes the same authority distinction and explicitly distinguishes pre-admission material from canonical logical GameSessionId.
  - ADR 0028 and OTERY​N_V2_ACCOUNT_IDENTITY_CONTRACT define canonical native AccountId as Platform-issued UUIDv7 and make canary_account_id legacy compatibility only.
  - Delivered GAME_GATEWAY_IDENTITY_CONTRACT redeem v1 still binds/returns canary_account_id and therefore remains a compatibility implementation, not proof of a native AccountId-bearing redeem context.
  - Historical Platform native gameplay/Game Session v2 artifacts are reconciliation evidence only and cannot define current Oteryn-v2 admission/session authority.
  - The orphaned predecessor branch already contained the focused semantic contract, Gateway routing clarification, integration-architecture update and review report.
derived:
  - A focused Platform semantic contract closes the Platform-side handoff ambiguity without selecting unfinished Oteryn-v2 wire or lease implementation.
  - Native implementation will require a separately authorized versioned Identity/Gateway redeem/login context that yields canonical AccountId before pre-admission issuance can be implemented safely.
unknown:
  - exact native AccountId-bearing redeem/login-context endpoint/version/runtime implementation
  - exact Oteryn-v2 FND-04 admission/session state machine
  - material transport/encoding/signing primitive
  - replay store and atomic consume implementation
  - lease/fencing algorithm
  - canonical GameSessionId wire form
conflicts: []
first_failure:
  marker: accountid-vs-legacy-redeem-v1-authority-ambiguity
  evidence: orphan-takeover review found branch wording depended on authoritative ticket redemption while delivered v1 exposes canary_account_id; ADR 0028 makes native AccountId authority narrower and canonical
rejected_hypotheses:
  - Platform-issued pre-admission material is a canonical gameplay session
  - historical Platform native Game Session v2 bytes define the Oteryn-v2 target
  - successful legacy Canary redeem v1 is sufficient proof of a native AccountId-bearing login context
  - native AccountId may be reconstructed from canary_account_id as canonical authority

validation:
  - command: orphaned-session recovery preflight
    result: PASS
    evidence: predecessor branch had no PR and no durable progress after 2026-08-08T09:29:35+02:00; existing branch was reused rather than duplicated
  - command: authority review against ADR 0028, Account Identity contract, ADR 0031 and Oteryn-v2 ADR-0003
    result: PASS
    evidence: native AccountId authority and game-domain final admission authority are now explicitly separated from legacy Canary redeem/session semantics
  - command: full changed-file semantic review
    result: PASS
    evidence: one material AccountId/redeem-v1 ambiguity was found and reconciled; zero unresolved material findings remain before final restack/CI
  - command: runtime/browser E2E
    result: NOT_RUN
    evidence: architecture/documentation only; no executable runtime or deployment behavior is authorized
