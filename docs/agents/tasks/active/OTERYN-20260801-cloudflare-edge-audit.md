# OTERYN-20260801-cloudflare-edge-audit

## Goal

Add and execute a protected read-only audit of the remaining Cloudflare edge controls after Tunnel and DNS convergence, without exposing the environment token or allowing trigger-branch code to run with it.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Audit implementation uses GET requests only.
- [x] Exact certificate coverage for `login.oteryn.molehill.cloud` is evaluated.
- [x] Redirect, Rulesets/WAF, Bot, Access, selected TLS settings and HSTS state are inspected when permissions allow.
- [x] Missing API permissions are classified without leaking credentials.
- [x] Pull-request validation uses deterministic mock API coverage.
- [x] Live audit code is checked out from trusted `main` under `pull_request_target`.
- [x] Trigger PR is restricted to one inert marker file.
- [ ] Implementation PR exact head passes all applicable workflows and is merged.
- [ ] Trigger PR executes the live audit and sanitized evidence is reviewed.

## Context checkpoint

proven:
  - Live Cloudflare audit 30699270139 and apply 30700054602 converged Tunnel/DNS.
  - Public revalidation 30701140509 proves Gateway TLS, WWW challenge, redirects and HSTS remain unresolved.
  - Existing endpoint automation intentionally cannot inspect or mutate certificates, Rulesets/WAF, Bot, Access, redirects or HSTS.
  - Local deterministic mock validation of the new audit passes.
unknown:
  - Whether the production-cloudflare token currently has read access to the remaining API families.
  - Whether Advanced Certificate Manager or another exact-host certificate product is available for the zone.
  - Which Cloudflare control produces the current public 403 challenge.
  - Current redirect, Access and HSTS rule ownership.
next_action: Merge the protected audit implementation, trigger one read-only live audit from trusted main, then design only the smallest evidence-supported repair.
```
