# OTERYN-20260724-editorial-support-legal

## Goal

Extend the existing CMS with typed editorial mappings, published-only public routes and a confirmed-MFA administrator workflow for launch Server Information, Beginner's Guide, support guidance, rules and required legal documents without introducing a second CMS, stored support tickets, arbitrary HTML or media uploads.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] All eight required public routes use stable typed keys and deterministic published, unpublished and missing behavior.
- [x] Draft and future-scheduled content is never exposed publicly.
- [x] Legal documents require and preserve version plus effective-date history.
- [x] Administrator mutations require `auth`, `mfa.confirmed` and exact `support.content.manage` authorization.
- [x] Privileged mutations create bounded audit records without page bodies, personal data or secrets.
- [x] Approved Discord, contact and support links are configuration-backed and reject unsafe or unapproved external URLs.
- [x] No stored ticket submission path, arbitrary HTML, executable upload or media upload is introduced.
- [x] Focused tests and all required CI pass on the implementation head.

proven:
  - PR #143 and PR #146 are merged and provide the public expansion plan plus deterministic module-local route, navigation and permission integration.
  - Existing managed pages remain the sole editorial persistence boundary; no second CMS was introduced.
  - No open task or pull request owns CMS managed-page persistence, typed editorial routes or support-content administration.
  - Eight typed routes resolve fixed managed-page keys and return safe distinct 404 states for missing and unpublished content.
  - Draft and future-scheduled title/body content is never passed to public views.
  - Generic managed-page administration and /pages/{slug} reject all reserved editorial slugs.
  - Published legal versions are preserved in additive immutable snapshots keyed by managed page and version.
  - Publishing legal content requires both version and effective date; changing published meaning requires a new version.
  - Support administration composes auth, confirmed MFA and exact support.content.manage middleware.
  - support.content.manage is explicitly granted only to content_editor and platform_admin roles.
  - Audit metadata is bounded to identifiers and publication/legal metadata and excludes page bodies, contact data and secrets.
  - Support links are emitted only from validated configuration-backed email or HTTPS allowlisted hosts.
  - Report-a-bug is guidance-only and no support POST route, ticket model, arbitrary HTML field, executable upload or media upload exists.
  - All changed paths avoid routes/web.php, the shared layout, header, footer, homepage, Downloads, Events, Wiki and PublicGameData implementation paths.
derived:
  - Fixed typed mappings reuse managed-page persistence while providing stable primary route contracts.
  - Immutable legal snapshots preserve historical meaning without requiring a parallel legal CMS.

first_failure:
  marker: local-checkout-unavailable
  evidence: sandbox DNS could not resolve github.com; repository reads and writes continued through the GitHub connector and exact-head GitHub CI
rejected_hypotheses:
  - A second support CMS is necessary.
  - A stored support-ticket form is required for report-a-bug guidance.
  - Existing generic /pages/{slug} is sufficient as the launch route contract.
  - Raw database date text is portable across SQLite and MariaDB.

## Notes

The public missing and unpublished states intentionally return HTTP 404 while rendering distinct safe guidance; neither state receives draft title or body data. Legal snapshots are immutable per page/version, so changing published legal meaning requires a new version. Authoritative rates, rules and legal wording are not fabricated or seeded; the administrator workflow identifies the required launch topics and publishes only reviewed content.
