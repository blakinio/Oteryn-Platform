# OTERYN-20260730-long-content-large-results

## Terminal scope

This archive preserves the completed bounded content-scale evidence slice for Issue #362. It is historical evidence only and grants no current ownership, lease, continuation authority or mutation scope.

## Delivered evidence

- Every delivered rendered surface received an explicit applicability classification.
- Applicable long-content and large-collection states were bound to exact executable evidence.
- Deterministic fixtures exercised long EN/PL values and bounded multi-page collections through real routes and data paths.
- Evidence verified wrapping, containment, stable pagination and no document-level horizontal overflow.
- Strict validators and deterministic negative fixtures fail closed.
- At the time Issue #362 and PRs #363/#369 completed, parent Issue #326 remained open for unrelated gaps.

## Ownership release

```yaml
owned_paths: []
shared_paths: []
leases: []
current_claim: none
next_action: none
```

All former ownership over content-scale evidence, acceptance scripts, package metadata, fixtures, CSS, views, routes and workflows is released. Any future work requires a new bounded Issue/task and fresh ownership.

## Branch lifecycle

The source branch was used only by terminal PRs #363 and #369. It is retained as historical Git evidence and is non-authoritative for continuation or ownership.

## Parent lifecycle clarification

Issue #326 was open when this bounded slice completed. Later independent work closed #326 as completed on 2026-08-03. This archive records both facts and neither claims responsibility for closing #326 nor reopens it.

## Nonclaims

This archive does not close or reopen Issue #326, claim overall product completeness from this slice, authorize evidence/harness changes, or prove staging/production state.
