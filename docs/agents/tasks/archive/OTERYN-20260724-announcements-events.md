# OTERYN-20260724-announcements-events

## Terminal scope

This archive preserves the completed Announcements and Events modules delivered by merged PR #157. It is historical evidence only and grants no current ownership, lease, continuation authority or mutation scope.

## Delivered boundary

- Deterministic UTC scheduling and publication windows.
- Localized event content and unique localized slugs.
- Confirmed-MFA administration with exact Announcements/Events permissions.
- Bounded audit metadata and explicit stale-edit conflicts.
- Public event routes plus reusable ticker/upcoming-event providers.
- Escaped plain-text content, validated action links and no image upload.
