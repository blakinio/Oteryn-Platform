# Phase 7 Production-Like Validation Evidence

## Purpose

This document records non-secret evidence produced by the controlled Phase 7 production-like validation workflow.

It does **not** treat CI/staging as final production.

Evidence classifications used here:

- `STAGING_PROVEN` — directly demonstrated by a successful controlled production-like workflow run on an exact commit SHA;
- `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — directly demonstrated in the final production environment;
- `UNKNOWN` — not yet proven for the stated environment.

A successful staging result may prove that a procedure, guardrail or least-privilege design works under controlled production-like conditions. It does not prove final production DNS, TLS, firewall, network isolation, provider configuration, deployed credentials, backup schedule, monitoring sink or exact deployed production SHA.

## Staging evidence matrix

| Boundary | Classification | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Exact staging validation SHA | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Workflow run 5 validated `b6dcd6ed95c55f400206864ffd6ff799e65aa2b3`. |
| Clean deployment | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Clean release directory was built from the exact validation SHA and activated through the controlled release pointer. |
| Migrations | `STAGING_PROVEN` | `php artisan migrate --force --no-interaction` passed against the production-like Platform MariaDB database. |
| Configuration guardrails | `STAGING_PROVEN` | `php artisan production:verify-configuration` passed; a deliberate `APP_DEBUG=true` mutation failed closed. |
| Health/readiness | `STAGING_PROVEN` | The deployed release booted and `/health` returned successfully. |
| Rollback | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Release pointer switched to `b6878c4775eda542738c78ea99fd5d2e19d2b35f`; configuration and migration-state smoke passed. |
| Interrupted deployment isolation | `STAGING_PROVEN` | An incomplete release directory was created without changing the active release pointer. |
| Redeploy current SHA | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Release pointer returned to `b6dcd6ed95c55f400206864ffd6ff799e65aa2b3`; migrations/configuration passed again. |
| Generic Canary read-only effective grants | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Real MariaDB principal provisioned from the reviewed SQL template; `canary:verify-db-privileges` passed. |
| Generic Canary write denial | `STAGING_PROVEN` | The read-only principal was denied an `UPDATE` attempt. |
| Generic Canary excess privilege fail-closed | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Temporary `UPDATE` privilege caused the application verifier to fail; privilege was revoked and the verifier passed again. |
| Provisioning effective grants | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Real MariaDB column-level principal provisioned from the reviewed SQL template; `canary:verify-provisioning-db-privileges` passed. |
| Provisioning insufficient privilege fail-closed | `STAGING_PROVEN` | A required column-level `SELECT` privilege was removed; the verifier failed, then passed after restoration. |
| Provisioning cross-surface write denial | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Provisioning principal was denied an attempted `players` insert. |
| Character-create effective grants | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Real MariaDB column-level principal provisioned from the reviewed SQL template; `canary:verify-character-create-db-privileges` passed. |
| Character-create cross-surface write denial | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Character-create principal was denied an attempted `accounts` update. |
| Canary DB unavailable behavior | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Privilege verification against an unavailable Canary endpoint failed closed. Application-level dependency degradation remains covered by the exact-SHA regression suite. |
| Runtime Redis ACL/key/command boundary | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Real Redis ACL user restricted to `cluster:channel:*:runtime` plus the required read commands successfully read valid runtime data; `SET` was denied with `NOPERM`. |
| Runtime Redis missing/expired semantics | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Missing runtime key returned no runtime state rather than fabricated availability. TTL validity is exercised by the real `PTTL` path and regression suite. |
| Runtime Redis malformed data | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Invalid status payload raised the expected fail-closed malformed-data behavior. |
| Runtime Redis unavailable behavior | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Reader against an unavailable Redis endpoint failed rather than returning fabricated healthy runtime data. |
| SMTP delivery-capable staging path | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Application delivered through a real SMTP protocol connection to a safe test SMTP service; Laravel `array`/`log` transport was not used as delivery evidence. |
| Mail-unavailable behavior | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Delivery against an unavailable SMTP endpoint failed as expected. |
| Session runtime path | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Controlled environment used the repository's file-session default; live web middleware produced a Secure and HttpOnly session cookie. This does not prove production multi-instance suitability. |
| Cache mode | `STAGING_PROVEN` | The controlled environment had no external cache dependency and used the repository's file-cache default; no production shared-cache requirement is inferred from this result. |
| Queue mode | `STAGING_PROVEN` | The controlled environment used the repository's synchronous queue mode and completed critical flows without an asynchronous worker dependency. Production queue topology remains a separate decision if scope changes. |
| Full exact-SHA regression suite | `STAGING_PROVEN` | The production-like workflow's isolated test environment completed `composer test`; required CI run 755 independently passed Composer audit, Pint, PHPStan and full tests on the same SHA. |
| Registration and Identity↔Canary binding | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Exact-SHA feature coverage validates registration, durable binding intent, ready binding and failure-to-pending behavior; MariaDB integration coverage separately exercises the real provisioning adapter and least-privilege boundary. |
| Login/logout and session revocation | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Exact-SHA Identity web-session feature coverage passed in the full suite. |
| Password recovery/change | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Exact-SHA password recovery/change feature coverage passed; the controlled environment separately proved a delivery-capable SMTP path. Final production provider/domain delivery remains `UNKNOWN`. |
| MFA | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Exact-SHA MFA state and web-flow feature coverage passed. |
| Administrator bootstrap and RBAC deny/allow | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Exact-SHA administrator authorization/role-management coverage passed, including deny-by-default policy and bootstrap invariants. |
| CMS and administrator audit | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Exact-SHA CMS management and administrator audit feature coverage passed. |
| Platform-originated account provisioning | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Exact-SHA provisioning action coverage plus real MariaDB integration tests and effective-grant verification passed. |
| Character creation | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Exact-SHA character-creation feature coverage plus real MariaDB integration tests and effective-grant verification passed. |
| Public news/character/search/online/highscores/servers flows | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Full exact-SHA feature/regression suite passed; live `/` and `/health` smoke passed; runtime server availability additionally used the real ACL-restricted Redis path. |
| CSP/browser security headers | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Live response contained CSP, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy`. |
| Secure/HttpOnly cookies | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Live login response set Secure and HttpOnly cookie attributes. |
| Request correlation | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Live response contained server-generated `X-Request-ID`. |
| Structured request logging | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Live request produced `http.request.completed` through the JSON-to-stderr logging channel. |
| Representative sensitive error/log behavior | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Representative 404 output did not expose a stack trace or ephemeral application key; request logs did not contain the key. This is a bounded representative check, not a proof that arbitrary future log messages are secret-free. |
| Rate limiting | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Exact-SHA registration/login/password-recovery security regression coverage passed. |
| Security/audit events | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Exact-SHA Identity and administrator audit regression coverage passed. |
| Platform DB backup | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Real MariaDB logical backup was created from the production-like Platform database using a consistent single-transaction dump. |
| Clean restore | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Backup restored into a newly created clean database. |
| Restore integrity | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Source/restored table counts matched `13/13`; migration counts matched `11/11`; a SHA-tagged restore probe matched the validated SHA. |
| Restored-environment smoke | `STAGING_PROVEN` | `migrate:status` and production configuration verification passed against the restored database. |
| Measured staging restore time | `STAGING_PROVEN` | Restore completed in `102 ms` for this controlled dataset on `2026-07-20`; this is **not** a production RTO or RPO. |
| HTTPS/TLS termination and reverse-proxy trust | `UNKNOWN` | The controlled run enforces HTTPS application configuration and Secure cookies but does not include the final edge/TLS/reverse-proxy topology. Must be verified in the final environment. |
| Centralized logging/metrics/alerts/on-call | `UNKNOWN` | Application JSON logging primitive is proven; final production sink, retention, access, alerting and on-call routing require final environment evidence. |

## Critical-flow evidence composition

The production-like evidence intentionally combines complementary layers instead of pretending one synthetic test proves everything:

1. the exact-SHA full feature/regression suite exercises registration, login/logout, password recovery/change, MFA, RBAC, administrator/CMS/audit, account/binding, character and public read flows;
2. MariaDB integration tests exercise real database transaction/privilege behavior for provisioning and character creation;
3. the environment workflow runs the three effective-grant verifiers against real dedicated MariaDB principals and actively proves prohibited cross-surface writes are denied;
4. the runtime Redis path uses a real ACL user and real TTL/hash reads;
5. mail delivery uses an actual SMTP protocol path to a safe test service;
6. the deployed release itself is live-smoked for health, browser headers, cookies, correlation and structured logging.

This composition is `STAGING_PROVEN`. It is not a substitute for final production smoke tests against the exact deployed production SHA.

## Recovery evidence interpretation

The measured `102 ms` restore time applies only to the small controlled staging dataset and runner used by workflow run 5. It must not be converted into a production RTO or RPO.

The deployment/rollback result proves the controlled release-directory and atomic pointer-switch model works. It does not prove that the final hosting provider uses that model or that provider-specific rollback access is configured correctly.

## Final production verification pass

The following items remain `UNKNOWN` until directly proven in the final production environment. This is the minimal production-only pass after staging-verifiable work is closed:

- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — exact deployed Oteryn Platform SHA and relevant Canary/login-server versions; confirm required CI passed for the exact production candidate.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — production DNS/proxy/Cloudflare/WAF/Access state and actual TLS termination/certificate behavior; make the HSTS decision from the real hostname/TLS policy.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — direct-origin exposure decision and effective ingress firewall/reverse-proxy restrictions.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — production Platform DB endpoint/topology/network isolation/HA and effective credential ownership/rotation.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — production generic Canary DB effective grants using `canary:verify-db-privileges` plus actual network-path separation.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — production provisioning DB effective grants using `canary:verify-provisioning-db-privileges`, if provisioning is enabled, plus actual dedicated credential/network-path separation.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — production character-create DB effective grants using `canary:verify-character-create-db-privileges`, if character creation is enabled, plus actual dedicated credential/network-path separation.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — production runtime Redis endpoint, network/TLS state and effective ACL for the dedicated read principal; prove dependency/freshness monitoring.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — effective production session/cache/queue choices, multi-instance suitability and worker supervision/retry/failed-job handling if asynchronous queues are introduced.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — production mail provider, sender-domain readiness, password-recovery delivery and delivery/bounce monitoring.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — production structured logging/metrics/alerting sink, retention/access policy, request-ID preservation and on-call routing.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — actual production deployment/migration/rollback mechanism, migration compatibility boundary and authorized emergency rollback operator path.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — production backup scope/schedule/retention/encryption/access policy and a dated production restore test with measured production recovery time and data-loss observation; staging restore time is not production RTO/RPO.
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` — final production health/readiness and critical smoke/E2E checks against the exact deployed SHA, including registration/login/logout/password recovery/MFA/admin/RBAC/CMS/provisioning/binding/character/public reads as applicable to launch scope.
- [ ] Resolve the separately authorized authoritative game-login bridge if Platform-originated game login is part of launch scope.

Phase 7 must remain IN PROGRESS until the applicable final production-only items are directly proven or an eligible risk is explicitly accepted by the owner under repository policy.
