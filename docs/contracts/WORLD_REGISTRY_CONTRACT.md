# Oteryn World Registry Contract

## Status

`PHASE 1 FOUNDATION IMPLEMENTED — PUBLIC GATEWAY USE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED`

This contract defines the authoritative world-routing model consumed by the future Oteryn Game Gateway.

Phase 1 implements the Platform-owned persistence and domain boundary. It does **not** yet expose world data through a public Gateway API, create Game Sessions, or prove a production world route.

The first deployment may contain exactly one world, but no API/domain contract may permanently assume a singleton.

## Phase 1 implementation status

Implemented in Oteryn Platform:

- `game_worlds` database table with non-singleton primary keys and unique slugs;
- `GameWorld` model;
- normalized `GameWorldStatus` vocabulary;
- account-aware `WorldRegistry` interface;
- fail-closed `DatabaseWorldRegistry` implementation;
- sanitized `GameWorldRoute` projection;
- no seeded world and no invented production hostname or port.

Current Phase 1 policy:

```text
positive redeemed Canary account ID
    -> all worlds where status=online
    -> AND login_enabled=true
    -> AND route fields are syntactically valid
```

This is an MVP authorization policy behind an account-aware interface. It is not a claim that every future account may access every future world.

Not implemented yet:

- Game Gateway consumption of the registry;
- character-to-world persistence for true multiworld;
- account/world entitlement policy beyond the single-world-ready MVP;
- world-scoped Canary Game Session enforcement;
- runtime health integration;
- world administration UI;
- production route configuration.

## Ownership

Oteryn Platform owns World Registry configuration and policy.

Game Gateway consumes World Registry through a narrow interface.

Canary remains the runtime owner of each game world/process.

OTClient consumes only sanitized routing data returned by Gateway.

## Goals

- one authoritative source for world names, regions and login routes;
- support one world immediately without singleton coupling;
- future multiworld/multiregion expansion without changing login architecture;
- world-scoped Game Session semantics;
- explicit maintenance/login availability;
- no client-controlled game endpoint routing;
- future channel allocation can extend, not replace, the model.

## Non-goals

The first release does not implement:

- gameplay-state synchronization across Canary instances;
- channel allocation;
- dynamic autoscaling;
- queues/capacity balancing;
- tournament enrollment policy;
- production DNS/load-balancer management.

## World identity

Minimum logical record:

```text
world_id
slug
name
region
status
login_enabled
game_host
game_port
```

Semantics:

```text
world_id       stable database primary identity
slug           unique stable machine identifier
name           player-facing display name
region         normalized region metadata
status         operational presentation state
login_enabled  authoritative gate for new login/session routing
game_host      authoritative client routing hostname or IP
game_port      authoritative client routing TCP port
```

Phase 1 persistence is the Platform database table:

```text
game_worlds
```

No production world row is seeded by the application. Deployment configuration must supply an exact verified route before a world can become login-available.

## Illustrative world only

The following remains an example and is **not** production evidence:

```yaml
world_id: 1
slug: oteryn-eu
name: Oteryn
region: EU
status: online
login_enabled: true
game_host: game-eu.oteryn.com
game_port: 7172
```

No production endpoint should be inferred from this document.

## Status vocabulary

Implemented values:

```text
online
maintenance
offline
unknown
```

Semantics:

- `online`: registry expects the world to be operational, subject to real runtime reachability;
- `maintenance`: intentionally unavailable/degraded for new player entry;
- `offline`: intentionally unavailable;
- `unknown`: authoritative runtime status cannot be determined.

`status` is operational/presentation state.

`login_enabled` is the explicit authorization/routing gate for new Game Session creation.

A world with `login_enabled=false` must not receive a new Game Session even if `status=online`.

Phase 1 `DatabaseWorldRegistry` returns only `online` + `login_enabled` worlds with syntactically routable host/port data.

## Fail-closed rules

For new login routing:

```text
invalid account identifier -> no worlds
missing world             -> deny
unknown authorization     -> deny
status != online          -> deny in Phase 1 registry projection
login_enabled = false     -> deny
invalid/missing route     -> deny
```

The exact future relationship between runtime health and persisted `status` remains an implementation decision. Phase 1 prefers fail closed.

## World authorization

Logical interface:

```text
WorldRegistry::forAccount(canary_account_id) -> list<GameWorldRoute>
```

The interface is account-aware from the first implementation.

Current MVP behavior accepts only a positive Canary account ID and then projects all eligible worlds. Future policy may narrow results for:

- test/preview access;
- tournament eligibility;
- region/product restrictions;
- maintenance allowlists;
- staff/internal worlds.

Client input cannot grant world access.

## Character association

Every Gateway-returned character must eventually resolve to a World Registry world.

Logical projection:

```text
character_name
world_id
```

For a single shared Canary database where existing `players` records do not encode world identity, a later single-world adapter may derive all current characters as belonging to the one configured world.

That would be explicit adapter behavior, not a claim that `players` intrinsically stores `world_id`.

Before true multiworld rollout, character-to-world persistence/ownership must be explicitly contracted and tested.

## Game Session world binding

Every target Game Session is logically bound to one `world_id`.

The Phase 1 Game Session value/interface contract carries `worldId`, but no Canary persistence adapter is implemented yet.

Gateway must eventually create/return routing only for the bound world.

OTClient cannot transform a session into authorization for another world by editing host/port.

Exact enforcement depends on the selected Game Session↔Canary adapter and remains an implementation gate.

## Sanitized Gateway projection

Target public projection:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "slug": "oteryn-eu",
  "name": "Oteryn",
  "region": "EU",
  "status": "online",
  "host": "game-eu.oteryn.com",
  "port": 7172
}
```

The example values are illustrative.

Do not expose:

- private/internal hostnames when separate from the public route;
- database connection data;
- management ports;
- health-check secrets;
- Canary service credentials;
- private channel/process identifiers not required by the client.

## Registry storage decision

Phase 1 selects **Platform database storage**.

Reasons:

- durable normalized model;
- natural multiworld expansion;
- Platform-owned write boundary;
- future audit/admin workflows can be added without changing world identity;
- no need to hard-code singleton routing in Gateway.

Requirements:

- migrations remain backward-compatible/reversible;
- writes remain Platform-owned;
- Gateway must consume through the `WorldRegistry` boundary rather than receive generic database authority;
- no route is treated as production-valid merely because it appears in documentation.

Trusted static configuration is no longer the selected Phase 1 persistence mechanism.

## Route validation

Persisted schema enforces:

- unique world primary identity;
- unique `slug`;
- bounded database field types;
- boolean `login_enabled`;
- unsigned port storage.

Registry projection additionally fails closed unless:

- `slug`, `name`, `region`, and `game_host` are non-empty;
- `game_host` is a syntactically valid IP or hostname;
- `game_port` is in `1..65535`;
- `status=online`;
- `login_enabled=true`.

Do not allow arbitrary URL schemes/paths where only host+port are expected.

## Trust boundary

OTClient is not authoritative for:

- world ID;
- world availability;
- host;
- port;
- region;
- access policy.

Game Gateway must use Registry values, not client-provided routing.

A future admin UI editing worlds is a privileged operation requiring:

- explicit RBAC permission;
- confirmed MFA under existing admin policy;
- validation;
- audit event;
- safe handling of endpoint changes.

Admin editing is not required for the MVP.

## Availability semantics

Registry availability and Canary reachability are distinct.

```text
status=online AND login_enabled=true
```

means the registry considers the world eligible for new routing under current policy.

It does not guarantee the Canary endpoint will still be reachable milliseconds later.

A future health/availability subsystem may update `status` or add a separate readiness source.

Do not infer an authoritative world outage solely from one failed client connection.

## Multiworld evolution

Future example:

```text
World Registry
├── oteryn-eu
├── oteryn-na
├── tournament
├── test
└── preview
```

Required before enabling multiple worlds:

- character-to-world ownership/persistence contract;
- account/world authorization policy;
- world-scoped Game Session enforcement;
- separate routing endpoints;
- maintenance behavior;
- cross-world character name semantics if databases are separated;
- exact Canary database/runtime topology;
- E2E per world.

## Multiregion evolution

`region` is metadata/policy, not automatic network routing.

Future multiregion may add:

```text
login_ingress_region
preferred_region
latency/capacity policy
region-specific Gateway endpoints
```

The first release must not make client geolocation or latency measurements authoritative for access control.

## Future channel extension

Future routing may add:

```text
world_id
channel_id
game_host
game_port
```

World remains the persistent player-facing logical world.

Channel is an allocated runtime subdivision/instance.

Channel allocation must not be implemented by overloading `world_id`.

Authentication remains:

```text
Identity
-> Ticket
-> Gateway
-> world authorization
-> optional future channel allocation
-> Game Session
```

Gameplay-state synchronization between channels is outside this contract.

## Maintenance behavior

Recommended transition:

```text
login_enabled=false
status=maintenance
```

Effects:

- no new Game Sessions;
- Gateway does not return the world as login-available;
- existing player connections are governed by separate operational/Canary policy;
- Registry alone does not imply forced disconnect.

## Endpoint changes

Changing `game_host`/`game_port` affects new routing responses.

Recommended safe operational sequence:

1. disable new login for the world;
2. wait/revoke outstanding short-lived entry sessions as policy requires;
3. change route;
4. validate target readiness;
5. re-enable login.

Exact deployment automation remains outside Phase 1.

## Phase 1 tests

Implemented focused tests prove:

- registry is empty by default;
- no production world route is invented/seeded;
- invalid account identifier returns no worlds;
- only online + login-enabled worlds are projected;
- malformed host is excluded;
- invalid port is excluded;
- sanitized route contains only approved route fields.

Additional persistence uniqueness is enforced by the database schema.

## Required future Gateway/MVP tests

Before public Gateway use, prove:

- one configured world loads through the Gateway registry boundary;
- missing world fails closed;
- `login_enabled=false` prevents Game Session creation;
- unauthorized account/world combination is omitted/denied once entitlement policy exists;
- Gateway response uses Registry route rather than client input;
- character references resolve to a known world;
- single-world character adapter does not claim intrinsic `players.world_id`;
- public projection does not expose private configuration fields.

## Required multiworld tests before Phase 9 completion

- account sees only authorized worlds;
- character lists preserve correct world association;
- session for world A cannot be used for world B according to the selected Canary adapter;
- maintenance world denies new sessions;
- one world outage does not corrupt other world routing;
- region/routing fields are returned correctly;
- duplicate/ambiguous character/world mapping fails closed;
- dynamic endpoint routing uses the exact selected world.

## Versioning

Initial registry/API projection belongs to:

```text
protocol_version = 1
```

Additive optional fields may be backward compatible.

Changing the meaning of `world_id`, session world binding, or routing authority is a breaking contract change.

## Remaining unknowns

1. Exact production Oteryn world public hostname/port.
2. Character-to-world persistence model for true multiworld.
3. Exact Game Session world-scope enforcement in Canary.
4. Future runtime health source and how it affects persisted `status` versus live readiness.
5. Future admin/world-management surface and its privileged write workflow.
6. Future per-account world entitlement persistence/policy beyond the current single-world-ready MVP.

These are not blockers for the implemented Phase 1 registry foundation, but they must be resolved before the corresponding functionality is implemented or claimed.
