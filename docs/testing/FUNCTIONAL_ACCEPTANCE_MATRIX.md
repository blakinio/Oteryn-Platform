# Functional Acceptance Matrix

## Scope and evidence rules

This matrix inventories the functional surface delivered on `main` and records the strongest directly available acceptance evidence after the Functional Acceptance follow-up program from PR #66.

Repository checkpoint evidence uses `PROVEN`, `DERIVED`, `UNKNOWN` and `CONFLICT`. Environment evidence uses `STAGING_PROVEN`, `PRODUCTION_PROVEN` and `UNKNOWN`.

For the coverage columns below:

- `PROVEN` means deterministic repository tests or inspected executable validation cover the behavior;
- `STAGING_PROVEN` means the behavior was exercised through controlled production-like dependencies and/or the exact-SHA running HTTP application at the documented boundary;
- `DERIVED` means the conclusion follows from proven adjacent evidence but was not directly exercised at that exact layer;
- `UNKNOWN` means sufficient direct evidence is not available;
- `—` means the layer is not applicable.

No staging evidence in this document is promoted to `PRODUCTION_PROVEN`.

## Current acceptance result

**Functional inventory: PROVEN for the currently delivered `main` surface.**

**Full functional acceptance for the staging-verifiable delivered surface: STAGING_PROVEN.**

The blocking gaps identified by PR #66 are closed by composed merged evidence:

- PR #67, merge commit `517968539bdfd7d189677b669bf0899c35fccec1`, supplies the production-like browser acceptance harness and live HTTP evidence for FAV-01 through FAV-03;
- final PR #67 head `2a8b341d197e94346b01da9a0ee2181034e39322` passed `Acceptance E2E and Visual UX` run `29810312159`, job `88569620450`, with artifact `acceptance-e2e-29810312159-1` (`8487281635`), digest `sha256:189381cdc76a0cb2c16442b73bff55af1e60a9c2bcc0eef4368c864fb0ef0978`;
- PR #73, merge commit `06d8d94aafd73de996eb4ea93705e8a45fbadafb`, supplies controlled Platform DB outage evidence for FAV-04;
- PR #74, merge commit `24eaa4ca5e38bb255db95a989c0ff02e954360f3`, supplies focused CMS publication-state and privileged-audit sensitive-data regressions for FAV-05;
- existing Phase 7 production-like validation remains the composed infrastructure, privilege, Redis, SMTP, release and recovery evidence layer.

Issues #68, #69, #70, #71 and #72 are satisfied by this merged evidence set.

Final production state remains `UNKNOWN`; production smoke and the Production Go-Live Gate remain pending direct execution against the exact deployed production SHA.

Visual / UI / UX Acceptance is a separate gate and remains `FAIL` until the dedicated UI/UX launch-readiness task resolves its evidenced blockers.

## Explicitly not implemented / not accepted as delivered scope

The following remain outside the delivered functional surface and must not be inferred from adjacent functionality:

- public existing-account claim/import flow;
- character deletion;
- character rename;
- self-service Canary binding unlink/rebind/transfer;
- account deletion;
- authoritative Platform game-login bridge unless separately authorized and implemented.

## Functional Acceptance follow-up register

| Follow-up | Result | Durable evidence |
|---|---|---|
| FAV-01 — Identity/MFA/session/CSRF live production-like E2E | `CLOSED / STAGING_PROVEN` | merged PR #67; issue #68 closed |
| FAV-02 — provisioning/binding/character/public live production-like E2E | `CLOSED / STAGING_PROVEN` | merged PR #67 + existing real-MariaDB integration/privilege evidence; issue #69 closed |
| FAV-03 — admin/RBAC/CMS/audit live production-like E2E | `CLOSED / STAGING_PROVEN` | merged PR #67 + PR #74 focused regressions; issue #70 closed |
| FAV-04 — Platform DB outage and bounded error/log validation | `CLOSED / STAGING_PROVEN` | merged PR #73; issue #71 closed |
| FAV-05 — focused CMS publication-state and audit-secret regressions | `CLOSED / PROVEN` | merged PR #74; issue #72 closed |

No remaining functional-acceptance staging gap is known for the currently delivered scope.

## Production smoke boundary

The minimal final production-only verification is maintained separately in `docs/testing/PRODUCTION_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md`.

Production-specific facts remain `UNKNOWN` until direct final-production execution against the exact deployed SHA. This includes final edge/TLS/origin posture, production data-service endpoints and effective grants, production Redis/mail/session/cache/queue topology, deployment/rollback/backup operations and the final critical production smoke/E2E pass.

Passing this matrix does not make Visual / UI / UX Acceptance pass and does not open the Production Go-Live Gate by itself.
