# Oteryn Synology staging deployment

This package targets early local/staging testing on Synology Container Manager. It is intentionally not a production deployment topology and does not satisfy the Production Go-Live Gate.

The NAS is a runtime target only. Platform, Game Gateway and the dedicated deployment-runner images are built on GitHub-hosted Actions runners. Canary must also be supplied as a compatible prebuilt image. The Synology deployment path performs image pulls, database/runtime initialization, migrations, health checks, World Registry configuration and runtime-image rollback; it does not compile C++ or Go source on the NAS.

## Runtime topology

```text
workstation/browser
        |
        | DSM reverse proxy (controlled HTTP/HTTPS ingress)
        v
Synology host loopback
  8000 -> Platform
  8080 -> Game Gateway
  7171 -> Canary legacy login rollback path

workstation/OTClient
        |
        | optional direct private-LAN game TCP only
        v
Synology exact private address
  7172 -> Canary game protocol

Docker private bridge
  Platform <-> MariaDB
  Platform <-> Redis
  Gateway -> HTTPS internal proxy -> Platform private API
  Gateway -> HTTPS internal proxy -> Canary Game Session issuer
```

The Gateway never receives database credentials. Its non-loopback dependencies use generated staging-only TLS certificates and hostname verification. MariaDB and Redis are not published on host ports. Platform, Gateway and Canary legacy login remain host-loopback-only even when game TCP is deliberately enabled for the LAN.

## Repository workflows

- `Build Synology Staging Images` runs on GitHub-hosted runners. Pull requests build without publishing. Trusted `main` pushes and explicit manual runs publish GHCR images tagged with `sha-<full-sha>`; `main` also receives the moving `main` tag.
- `Deploy Synology Staging` is manual only, refuses non-`main` workflow dispatches and targets only the custom runner label `oteryn-staging`.
- The deployment runner is registered with `--no-default-labels`, so generic repository jobs targeting ordinary `self-hosted` runners do not match it.
- Any temporary one-shot deployment workflow must be removed after its bounded deployment and sanitized evidence are complete.

## First-time setup order

1. Merge a reviewed version of this package so GitHub-hosted Actions can publish:
   - `ghcr.io/blakinio/oteryn-platform`;
   - `ghcr.io/blakinio/oteryn-game-gateway`;
   - `ghcr.io/blakinio/oteryn-deploy-runner`.
2. Provide a compatible prebuilt Canary image that includes the required Game Session issuer. Do not silently substitute the generic upstream image when native-auth testing is expected.
3. Register the dedicated runner on Synology using the procedure below.
4. Create the GitHub Environment `synology-staging` and configure its staging-only secrets/variables.
5. Run `Deploy Synology Staging` manually from `main`, preferably with an exact `sha-<full-sha>` Platform/Gateway image tag.

## Register the dedicated Synology runner

The one remaining non-repository bootstrap action is obtaining a short-lived repository runner registration token from:

```text
Oteryn-Platform -> Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> New self-hosted runner
```

Do not commit or paste that token into issues, PRs, logs or chat.

The supplied runner project is `deploy/synology/runner/compose.yml`. It mounts the Docker socket because its only responsibility is deploying the Oteryn staging stack. Docker-socket access is effectively host-level container control, so keep this runner repository-scoped, private and dedicated to the `oteryn-staging` label.

Before creating the Container Manager project, create a persistent state directory on Synology, for example:

```text
/volume1/docker/oteryn/state
```

Copy `deploy/synology/runner/.env.example` to a local `.env` and set the one-time `RUNNER_TOKEN`. If GHCR requires authentication to pull the private runner package, configure Container Manager with a GitHub credential that has only the package-read access needed for this pull. Do not store that credential in Git.

Create/start the runner project. When GitHub shows `oteryn-synology-staging` online with label `oteryn-staging`:

1. remove `RUNNER_TOKEN` from the Container Manager project environment;
2. restart the runner container;
3. confirm the runner returns online without the registration token.

The persistent `runner_config` volume retains the registered runner credentials. The short-lived registration token is not needed after first registration.

## GitHub Environment configuration

Create an Environment named `synology-staging`.

Required secrets:

```text
OTERYN_STAGING_APP_KEY
OTERYN_STAGING_MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD
OTERYN_STAGING_PLATFORM_DB_PASSWORD
OTERYN_STAGING_CANARY_DB_PASSWORD
OTERYN_STAGING_CANARY_READONLY_DB_PASSWORD
OTERYN_STAGING_CANARY_PROVISIONING_DB_PASSWORD
OTERYN_STAGING_CANARY_CHARACTER_CREATE_DB_PASSWORD
OTERYN_STAGING_REDIS_PASSWORD
OTERYN_STAGING_CANARY_RUNTIME_REDIS_PASSWORD
OTERYN_STAGING_PLATFORM_SERVICE_TOKEN
OTERYN_STAGING_PLATFORM_SERVICE_TOKEN_SHA256
OTERYN_STAGING_GAME_SESSION_SERVICE_TOKEN
OTERYN_STAGING_GAME_SESSION_SERVICE_TOKEN_SHA256
```

Optional rotation secrets:

```text
OTERYN_STAGING_PLATFORM_PREVIOUS_SERVICE_TOKEN_SHA256
OTERYN_STAGING_GAME_SESSION_PREVIOUS_SERVICE_TOKEN_SHA256
```

Recommended variables:

```text
OTERYN_STAGING_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/oteryn-staging-state
OTERYN_STAGING_APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Generate independent high-entropy staging service tokens and store their exact SHA-256 digests in the matching hash secrets. The deploy script verifies both plaintext/hash pairs before changing the stack.

For database passwords used by the staging grant renderer, use random hexadecimal/alphanumeric values. The deploy script rejects unsupported characters rather than attempting unsafe SQL interpolation.

## Binding policy

The rendered deployment environment has four separate host bind controls:

```text
PLATFORM_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
GATEWAY_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
CANARY_LOGIN_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
CANARY_GAME_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
```

The first three must remain exact loopback. `CANARY_GAME_BIND_ADDRESS` may be loopback or one exact RFC1918 private IPv4 address. Wildcard, public, multicast and link-local addresses are rejected.

`CANARY_SERVER_IP` and `GAME_WORLD_HOST` must exactly equal `CANARY_GAME_BIND_ADDRESS`; `GAME_WORLD_PORT` must equal `CANARY_GAME_PORT`. This prevents Gateway from returning an unreachable or different route to OTClient.

## Deployment behavior

A `deploy` run:

1. checks out trusted `main` on the self-hosted runner;
2. logs in to GHCR with the job-scoped token;
3. validates all bind, route, image and secret inputs;
4. writes a permission-restricted ephemeral `.env` from GitHub Environment secrets;
5. validates required values and service-token hashes;
6. pulls prebuilt images;
7. starts MariaDB, Redis and internal TLS bootstrap;
8. starts Canary and waits for the required schema tables;
9. applies the repository-owned least-privilege Canary SQL grant templates without emitting `SHOW GRANTS` output;
10. configures the read-only runtime Redis ACL;
11. starts Platform, runs migrations and ensures the native OAuth client exists;
12. runs the three Canary database privilege verifiers;
13. starts the internal TLS proxy and Game Gateway;
14. verifies Platform/Gateway health, Canary TCP reachability and every exact host-port binding;
15. when a private game bind is configured, proves the game TCP endpoint is reachable through that NAS address;
16. only after those checks, creates or updates the exact enabled online Platform World Registry route;
17. removes the ephemeral `.env` after the job.

The script snapshots currently running Platform/Gateway/Canary image references before an update. `rollback` restores those runtime images and re-runs health checks. It intentionally does **not** reverse database migrations automatically.

## Early workstation testing through loopback

The safe default binds Platform, Gateway and Canary ports only to Synology loopback. From a workstation with SSH access to the NAS, forward them locally:

```bash
ssh \
  -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 \
  -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 \
  -L 7171:127.0.0.1:7171 \
  -L 7172:127.0.0.1:7172 \
  <synology-user>@<synology-host>
```

For this early loopback path, configure OTClient's Oteryn endpoints as literal `http://127.0.0.1` URLs and enable its development-only insecure-loopback option. Do not use this HTTP exception for a LAN hostname, public hostname or production environment.

## Deliberate local-LAN game access

For the current Synology host at `192.168.1.2`, the guarded staging deployment uses:

```text
CANARY_GAME_BIND_ADDRESS=192.168.1.2
CANARY_SERVER_IP=192.168.1.2
GAME_WORLD_ID=1
GAME_WORLD_HOST=192.168.1.2
GAME_WORLD_PORT=7172
```

This exposes only Canary game TCP `192.168.1.2:7172`. Platform `8000`, Gateway `8080` and legacy login `7171` remain on `127.0.0.1`.

DSM Firewall must permit inbound TCP `7172` only from the trusted home LAN subnet or, preferably, the exact workstation address. Do not create router/NAT forwarding for `7172` as part of LAN-only testing.

The browser/OAuth and Gateway endpoints are separate HTTP surfaces. A native OTClient using a LAN hostname requires controlled HTTPS endpoints with a certificate trusted by the workstation; direct game TCP exposure alone does not configure the desktop client.

## Manual local execution

The same deployment package can be executed from a trusted Linux deployment host with Docker Compose v2:

```bash
cp deploy/synology/.env.example deploy/synology/.env
# Fill staging-only values outside Git.
bash deploy/synology/scripts/deploy.sh
```

Health check:

```bash
bash deploy/synology/scripts/health-check.sh
```

Runtime-image rollback:

```bash
bash deploy/synology/scripts/rollback.sh
```

## Non-goals and blockers

- This package does not make staging evidence `PRODUCTION_PROVEN`.
- It does not expose DSM, Docker Engine TCP, MariaDB, Redis or the Canary Game Session issuer publicly.
- It does not build Canary on Synology.
- It does not authorize router port forwarding or Internet exposure of game TCP.
- It does not activate legacy password authentication for Platform-created Canary accounts.
- A fully usable desktop native-login flow additionally requires an exact compatible OTClient build and trusted browser/OAuth/Gateway endpoint configuration.
